In this step, you'll <strong>play the Snake game</strong> and observe its behavior. Think like a game designer or detective: what rules control the game? What happens when the snake eats something? How does the snake move? What causes the game to end?</p> <p>Use the <strong>text field on the left</strong> to write down all the rules and patterns you notice. There are no wrong answers — this is about observation and curiosity.</p> <p>Once you're done, click the <strong>Save</strong> button to continue to the next part of the workshop, where we’ll start designing and tweaking the game together!</p>",
