# 🐍 Snake Game Web IDE

This is an interactive **Web IDE** built to teach game development using the classic **Snake game** written in **Phaser.js**.
The IDE is designed for **educational workshops**, allowing learners to explore how games are built by playing, modifying, and debugging game logic in real time.

>[!NOTE]
> Created for a [**Royal Institution**](https://www.rigb.org) workshop to introduce students to game programming concepts using JavaScript and visual programming techniques.

## Features

- **Step-by-step Debugger** – Execute the game loop one frame at a time.
- **7 Learning Exercises** – From playing the game to writing the rules and implementing the snake’s controller.
- **Live Preview** – See the game update as you modify logic.

## Tech Stack
- Built using [Phaser.js](https://phaser.io/), a fast and fun HTML5 game framework.
- Uses Redux to manage game and UI state cleanly.
- Built with TypeScript, React, Redux, and Vite.js for blazing-fast development.
