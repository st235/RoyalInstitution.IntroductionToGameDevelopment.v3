In this step, you'll <strong>play the Snake game</strong> and observe its behavior. Think like a game designer or detective: what rules control the game? What happens when the snake eats something? How does the snake move? What causes the game to end?</p> <p>Use the <strong>text field on the left</strong> to write down all the rules and patterns you notice. There are no wrong answers — this is about observation and curiosity.</p> <p>Once you're done, click the <strong>Save</strong> button to continue to the next part of the workshop, where we’ll start designing and tweaking the game together!</p>",

Now that you understand the game rules, it's time to shape the game world yourself.</p> <p>In this exercise, you'll define a custom <strong>obstacle layout</strong> using a simple text configuration format. This layout will determine where the snake can move — and where it can’t!</p> <p>Your configuration should follow this format:</p> <pre>#rows,#columns<br>%unoccupied cell symbol%,%obstacle symbol%<br>%obstacles map goes here%</pre> <p><strong>Example:</strong></p> <pre>10,10<br>0,X<br>0000000000<br>00X0000000<br>0000000000<br>0000XXX000<br>0000000000<br>00X0000000<br>0000000000<br>0000000000<br>0000000000<br>0000000000</pre><p><strong>Legend:</strong></p> <ul> <li><code>0</code> = empty space (the snake can move here)</li> <li><code>X</code> = obstacle (the snake cannot move here)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Make sure:</strong></p> <ul> <li>The number of rows and columns matches your actual map layout.</li> <li>Every row contains exactly the number of columns you specified.</li> <li>You experiment with different obstacle placements to create fun or tricky paths!</li> </ul> <p>When you're done, click <strong>Save</strong> to try it out and continue to the next part.</p>",
